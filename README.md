Design Documentation for The Gaming Room

1.1 - The Gaming Room is a client that currently has an Android based game called “Draw it or Lose it.” This is an 80’s-based game that pits teams of players against other teams in attempting to guess what an image is as the image is slowly being resolved over 30 seconds. The guessing team has 1 minute to guess and if they do not get it correct, it goes to the next team who has 15 seconds to guess. The team with the most correct guesses after four rounds wins. 

1.2 - We have been hired to take their current Android game and use it as a template to develop a multi-platform web-based version of “Draw it or Lose it.” The Gaming Room wants to keep the feel and fun of the Android game and bring it to a larger audience by way of making it web-based, with the goal of being in the Mac, Windows, Linux, and Mobile device arenas.

2.0 - I think I was able to keep the document presented in a professional manner and at a level that is understandable by a large audience. 

3.0 - Understanding how the game actually worked on a deeper level really helped with writing the code. By knowing how the teams were broken down and how they interacted with each other, it made the flow chart understandable. It was also helpful in understanding which classes needed which functions in order to tailor the classes exactly. 

4.0 - If I could revise anything it would be spending more time researching the options for program development on each platform. I did not have much time to dig into each option and fully understand the capabilities. 

5.0 - The user’s needs are one of the most important aspects of game design as the user ultimately makes or breaks the game’s success. If the game does not have the same appeal and hook of the original, the game will not draw in the player base that it should and will cause the game to flop. The original game is successful and that is for a reason. Using the original game’s UI as a template and attempting to keep the same look and feel of the Android version is critical in duplicating the success. If a user comes into the game expecting the feel of the Android version only to find the whole game is changed, it might drive them off as they might not want to relearn the game. Or, they might just go back to the Android version as they get the same game play without the learning curve. 

6.0 - One thing I will take with me is to really lay out the design and requirements before trying to dig into coding. Understanding what the game will look like on paper can help iron out a lot of the issues later in development. Creating flow charts and documenting classes and dependencies can help complete a lot of the work before any code is even written. Then, when it is time to code, it is simply input into the IDE, without as much head scratching and frustration.
